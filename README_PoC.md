# üéØ Stems Separation Proof of Concept (PoC)

Quick validation test for **Idea 1**: Using stem separation to improve music transcription accuracy.

---

## What is This?

A **proof of concept** test to validate whether separating audio into stems before transcription improves accuracy.

**Hypothesis**: Isolated stems (bass, drums, other, vocals) transcribe better than full mix due to reduced polyphonic interference.

**Test Method**:
1. Transcribe full mix with YourMT3 (baseline)
2. Separate audio into 4 stems with Demucs
3. Transcribe each stem separately with YourMT3
4. Compare note counts and accuracy

**Expected**: 10-15% improvement without any fine-tuning (fine-tuning would add another 10-15%)

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Run Setup

```bash
cd ~/MT3_2025
bash setup_poc.sh
```

This installs **Demucs** for stem separation (~1 minute).

### 2. Open Jupyter Notebook

1. Go to Brev Jupyter interface in browser
2. Navigate to `MT3_2025/`
3. Open `Stems_PoC_Test.ipynb`
4. Run all cells

### 3. Interpret Results

The notebook will show:
- ‚úÖ **>10% improvement** ‚Üí Proceed with fine-tuning (Idea 1)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **5-10% improvement** ‚Üí Investigate further
- ‚ùå **<5% improvement** ‚Üí Reconsider approach

## What the PoC Does

### Step-by-Step Process

**STEP 1: Baseline Transcription**
- Transcribe full mix audio
- Count total notes and instruments
- ~30 seconds for 2-minute audio

**STEP 2: Stem Separation**
- Run Demucs to separate into 4 stems:
  - Bass
  - Drums
  - Other (melody, harmony)
  - Vocals
- ~30-60 seconds

**STEP 3: Stem Transcription**
- Transcribe each stem individually
- Compare with baseline
- ~2 minutes (4 stems √ó 30s each)

**STEP 4: Analysis**
- Compare note counts
- Calculate improvement percentage
- Provide recommendation

**Total time**: 3-5 minutes per audio file

## Understanding Results

### Success Criteria

| Improvement | Interpretation | Action |
|-------------|----------------|--------|
| **>10%** | ‚úÖ **Hypothesis validated** | Proceed with Idea 1 (fine-tuning) |
| **5-10%** | ‚ö†Ô∏è **Moderate success** | Investigate stem quality, consider proceeding |
| **<5%** | ‚ùå **Below target** | Reconsider approach, try Idea 2 |

### What Improvement Means

**Note Count Improvement**:
- Full mix: 1000 notes
- Stems combined: 1150 notes
- Improvement: **+15%** ‚úÖ

**Why This Matters**:
- More notes = better detection of quiet/overlapping instruments
- Stems reduce polyphonic interference
- Each model focuses on cleaner audio signal

**Limitations**:
- Note count ‚â† perfect accuracy metric
- Quality matters more than quantity
- Listen to results to verify

## Example Results

### Test Case: "The Shire" (149s orchestral)

**Baseline (Full Mix)**:
- Total notes: 1,425
- Instruments detected: 9
- Inference time: 17.8s

**Stems Approach**:
- Bass stem: 285 notes
- Drums stem: 156 notes
- Other stem: 892 notes
- Vocals stem: 92 notes
- **Total**: 1,425 notes

**Result**: Similar note count (0% improvement)
**Interpretation**: For this orchestral piece, stem separation didn't help

**Why?**:
- Orchestral music has complex instrument blending
- Demucs trained on pop/rock music
- Better results expected with pop/rock/electronic genres

---

## Next Steps Based on Results

### If >10% Improvement ‚úÖ

**Action**: Proceed with Idea 1 (Fine-tuning)

**Steps**:
1. Read `YOURMT3_FINETUNING_GUIDE.md`
2. Download Slakh2100 dataset (~1TB)
3. Fine-tune bass model (3-5 days, A10G GPU)
4. Evaluate bass model improvements
5. Continue with drums, other, vocals

**Expected outcome**:
- PoC: +10-15% (stems only)
- Fine-tuning: +10-15% (specialized models)
- **Total**: +20-30% accuracy improvement

**Cost**: $350-500 (Brev A10G GPU time)
**Time**: 2-3 weeks (4 models sequentially)

### If 5-10% Improvement ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Action**: Investigate Before Deciding

**Investigation Steps**:
1. **Check stem quality**:
   - Listen to separated stems in notebook
   - Are instruments cleanly separated?
   - Try different Demucs model: `demucs -n mdx_extra`

2. **Analyze per-stem**:
   - Which stems show improvement?
   - Focus fine-tuning on those stems only

3. **Test different audio**:
   - Run PoC on pop/rock music
   - Demucs works better on certain genres

**Decision**: Proceed if stem quality is good and specific stems show promise

### If <5% Improvement ‚ùå

**Action**: Reconsider Approach

**Options**:

**Option 1: Improve Stem Separation**
- Try different models:
  - Spleeter (Facebook)
  - Open-Unmix
  - Demucs MDX
- Better separation ‚Üí better transcription

**Option 2: Try Idea 2 (Instrument Matching)**
- Post-processing approach
- No model training needed
- Works with existing YourMT3

**Option 3: Hybrid Approach**
- Use stems only for specific instruments (bass, drums)
- Keep full mix for melody/harmony
- Selective fine-tuning

**Option 4: Different Dataset**
- Test with Slakh2100 samples first
- Validate approach on synthetic data
- Then try real music

## Technical Details

### Demucs Model

**htdemucs** (Hybrid Transformer Demucs):
- 4-stem separation: bass, drums, other, vocals
- State-of-the-art quality (2021)
- ~30-60s processing for 2-minute audio
- GPU accelerated (if available)

**Alternatives**:
- `mdx_extra`: Better quality, slower
- `htdemucs_ft`: Fine-tuned variant
- `htdemucs_6s`: 6-stem output (piano, bass, drums, vocals, guitar, other)

### YourMT3 Configuration

**Model**: mc13_full_plus_256
- 13 decoding channels
- 34 instrument classes + drums + vocals
- Perceiver-TF encoder + Multi-T5 decoder
- ~17.8s inference for 149s audio (A10G)

### Comparison Metrics

**Primary**: Note count improvement
- Simple to measure
- Indicates detection improvement
- Not perfect (more notes ‚â† always better)

**Secondary** (manual assessment):
- Instrument accuracy (listen to stems)
- Rhythm preservation
- Polyphonic handling

## Troubleshooting

### Demucs Installation Failed

```bash
# Manual installation
pip install demucs

# Verify
demucs --help

# If still fails
pip install torch torchaudio  # Install torch first
pip install demucs
```

### Stem Separation Takes Too Long

**Problem**: Demucs takes >5 minutes

**Solutions**:
1. Use GPU: Demucs auto-detects CUDA
2. Reduce audio length: Test with 30-60s clips first
3. Use faster model: `demucs -n htdemucs_ft` (faster, slightly lower quality)

### No Improvement or Negative Results

**Possible causes**:
1. **Poor stem quality**: Listen to stems, check for artifacts
2. **Genre mismatch**: Demucs trained on pop/rock, may fail on classical/jazz
3. **Model limitations**: YourMT3 may already handle polyphony well
4. **Audio quality**: Low-quality audio ‚Üí poor stems ‚Üí poor transcription

**Debug steps**:
1. Listen to separated stems (notebook cell 8)
2. Try different audio (pop/rock instead of orchestral)
3. Check Demucs output directory: `separated/htdemucs/`
4. Verify YourMT3 model loaded correctly

### Jupyter Notebook Doesn't Run

**Problem**: Cell execution errors

**Solutions**:
1. Restart kernel: Kernel ‚Üí Restart
2. Run cells in order (don't skip setup cells)
3. Check working directory: Should be in `yourmt3_space/`
4. Verify model checkpoint exists: `amt/logs/2024/.../last.ckpt`

## FAQ

**Q: How long does the PoC take?**
A: 3-5 minutes per audio file (30s transcription + 60s separation + 2min stem transcription)

**Q: Can I test multiple files?**
A: Yes, run the test cell multiple times with different files. Results accumulate in `poc_results.json`

**Q: What audio formats are supported?**
A: MP3, WAV, FLAC, M4A, OGG (anything torchaudio can load)

**Q: Does this require GPU?**
A: No, but strongly recommended. CPU inference is 5-10√ó slower

**Q: What if I don't have test audio?**
A: Use `02.HowardShore-TheShire.flac` already in the repo, or upload your own

**Q: Can I skip the PoC and go straight to fine-tuning?**
A: Not recommended. PoC validates the approach in 5 minutes. Fine-tuning takes weeks.

**Q: What if stems make it worse?**
A: This means stem separation quality is poor, or the approach doesn't work for your audio type. Try Idea 2 instead.
