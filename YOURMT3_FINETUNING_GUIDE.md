## What is Fine-Tuning?

### Definition

**Fine-tuning** = Continue training an already-trained model on new, specific data with lower learning rate.

### Why Fine-Tuning (vs Full Retraining)?

| Aspect | Full Training | Fine-Tuning |
|--------|---------------|-------------|
| **Starting point** | Random weights | Pre-trained checkpoint (536MB) |
| **Data required** | ~1000+ hours | 50-200 hours sufficient |
| **Training time** | 2-4 weeks (2x A100) | 2-7 days (1x A10G) |
| **Learning rate** | 1e-3 (high) | 1e-5 (low) |
| **Epochs** | 100-1000 | 10-50 |
| **Risk** | High (might not converge) | Low (starts from working model) |
| **Cost** | $2000-5000 (cloud GPUs) | $100-500 |

### Why Fine-Tuning Works for Idea 1

**Hypothesis**: YourMT3 already learned general music understanding (pitch, rhythm, timbre). Fine-tuning on isolated stems teaches it to:
- Focus on single instrument families without polyphonic interference
- Recognize bass-specific patterns (slap, fingerstyle, etc.)
- Distinguish drum techniques (ghost notes, flams, etc.)
- Handle vocal-specific features (vibrato, melisma, etc.)

**Analogy**: Model already knows "music grammar". Fine-tuning teaches it specialized "dialects" (bass, drums, vocals, other).

---

## Evidence from YourMT3 Codebase

### 1. Training Script Exists

**File**: `yourmt3_space/amt/src/train.py`

**Key features**:
- ✅ Checkpoint loading: Lines 174-180
- ✅ Fine-tuning support: `--resume_from_checkpoint`
- ✅ Learning rate control: `-lr` argument (line 96)
- ✅ Optimizer selection: AdamW, AdaFactor (line 97)
- ✅ Epoch control: `--max-epochs` (line 93)

```python
# Lines 174-180: Checkpoint loading for fine-tuning
if dir_info["last_ckpt_path"] is not None:
    checkpoint = torch.load(dir_info["last_ckpt_path"])
    state_dict = checkpoint['state_dict']
    model.load_state_dict(state_dict, strict=False)  # strict=False allows partial loading
    trainer.fit(model, datamodule=dm)
```

**Interpretation**: `strict=False` means you can load the full checkpoint and fine-tune even if you modify the task or vocabulary slightly.

### 2. Stem-Level Training Supported

**File**: `yourmt3_space/amt/src/config/data_presets.py`

**Slakh2100 preset** (lines 264-272):
```python
"slakh": {
    "eval_vocab": [GM_INSTR_CLASS],
    "eval_drum_vocab": drum_vocab_presets["gm"],
    "dataset_name": "slakh",
    "train_split": "train",
    "validation_split": "validation",
    "test_split": "test",
    "has_stem": True,  # ← STEM SUPPORT CONFIRMED
},
```

**What this means**: The data loader can feed individual stems (bass.wav, drums.wav, other.wav, vocals.wav) to the model during training.

### 3. Training Configuration

**File**: `yourmt3_space/amt/src/config/config.py`

**Batch sizes** (lines 137-141):
```python
"BSZ": {
    "train_sub": 12,    # Sub-batch size per CPU worker
    "train_local": 24,  # Local batch size per GPU
    "validation": 64,   # Validation batch size
    "test": 128,        # Test batch size (GPU) / 16 (CPU)
}
```

**Memory requirements**:
- Per-sample: ~2GB audio → ~256 time steps → ~50MB GPU memory
- Batch of 24: ~1.2GB GPU memory for data
- Model weights: ~2GB (bf16-mixed precision)
- Gradients + optimizer states: ~4GB
- **Total**: ~7-8GB VRAM **per GPU**

**A10G has 24GB VRAM** → You can fine-tune comfortably ✅

**Learning rate** (line 192):
```python
"LR_SCHEDULE": {
    "warmup_steps": 1000,
    "total_steps": 100000,  # Can be reduced for fine-tuning
    "final_cosine": 1e-5,   # Final LR for cosine schedule
}
```

**Augmentation** (lines 143-157):
```python
"AUGMENTATION": {
    "train_random_amp_range": [0.8, 1.1],      # Volume variations
    "train_stem_iaug_prob": 0.7,               # Intra-stem augmentation
    "train_stem_xaug_policy": {                # Cross-stem augmentation
        "max_k": 3,
        "tau": 0.3,
        "alpha": 1.0,
        "no_instr_overlap": True,
        "no_drum_overlap": True,
    },
    "train_pitch_shift_range": [-2, 2],        # Pitch shift ±2 semitones
}
```

**What this means**: Built-in augmentation strategies specifically designed for stem-level training.

### 4. Multiple Training Tasks Supported

**File**: `yourmt3_space/amt/src/config/task.py`

**Available tasks** (lines 14-119):
- `mt3_midi`: 11 instrument classes + drums
- `mt3_full_plus`: 34 classes + drums + singing ← **Current model uses this**
- `mc13_full_plus_256`: Multi-channel (13 channels) ← **Your checkpoint**
- `singing_v1`: Singing-only transcription
- `singing_drum_v1`: Singing + drums only

**Custom task example** for bass-only fine-tuning:
```python
"bass_only": {
    "name": "bass_only",
    "train_program_vocab": {
        "Bass": np.arange(32, 40),  # Only bass programs
    },
    "train_drum_vocab": {},  # No drums
}
```

**What this means**: You can create specialized tasks (bass, drums, melody, vocals) by modifying task configuration.

## Fine-Tuning Procedure

### Step 1: Setup Environment

```bash
# On Brev A10G instance
cd ~/MT3_2025/yourmt3_space

# Verify YourMT3 dependencies installed
pip install pytorch-lightning transformers wandb

# Login to Weights & Biases (for training logs)
wandb login
```

### Step 2: Prepare Checkpoint

```bash
# Current checkpoint location
ls amt/logs/2024/mc13_256_g4_all_v7_mt3f_sqr_rms_moe_wf4_n8k2_silu_rope_rp_b36_nops/checkpoints/last.ckpt

# Verify checkpoint loads
python -c "import torch; ckpt = torch.load('amt/logs/2024/.../last.ckpt'); print(list(ckpt.keys()))"
# Should output: ['state_dict', 'optimizer_states', 'lr_schedulers', ...]
```

### Step 3: Download Dataset

```bash
# Download Slakh2100 (16kHz version)
# Option 1: Direct download (~1TB)
wget https://zenodo.org/record/4599666/files/slakh2100_flac_16k.tar.gz

# Option 2: Torrent (faster)
transmission-cli https://zenodo.org/record/4599666/files/slakh2100.torrent

# Extract
tar -xzf slakh2100_flac_16k.tar.gz -C ~/data/
```

### Step 4: Create Stem-Specific Task

```python
# Create: amt/src/config/task.py addition

"bass_ft": {  # Bass fine-tuning task
    "name": "bass_ft",
    "train_program_vocab": {
        "Bass": np.arange(32, 40),  # Programs 32-39
    },
    "train_drum_vocab": {},  # No drums
    "num_decoding_channels": 1,  # Single channel for bass
    "max_note_token_length_per_ch": 512,
}
```

### Step 5: Fine-Tune Bass Model

```bash
cd amt/src

# Fine-tune bass-specialized model
python train.py bass_ft_experiment \
    -p bass_finetuning \
    -d slakh_bass_only \
    -tk bass_ft \
    -enc perceiver-tf \
    -dec t5 \
    -nl 26 \
    -sqr 1 \
    -ff moe \
    -wf 4 \
    -nmoe 8 \
    -kmoe 2 \
    -act silu \
    -epe rope \
    -rp 1 \
    -ac spec \
    -hop 300 \
    -atc 1 \
    -lr 1e-5 \
    -e 20 \
    -bsz 12 24 \
    -pr bf16-mixed \
    -wb online \
    -g 1

# Key arguments explained:
# bass_ft_experiment: Experiment ID (creates new checkpoint dir)
# -p bass_finetuning: Project name for WandB
# -d slakh_bass_only: Dataset preset (created in data_presets.py)
# -tk bass_ft: Task (single-channel bass)
# -lr 1e-5: Lower learning rate (vs 1e-3 for full training)
# -e 20: 20 epochs (vs 100+ for full training)
# -bsz 12 24: Batch sizes (sub=12, local=24)
# -wb online: Enable WandB logging
```

**Expected output**:
```
Loading checkpoint from: amt/logs/2024/.../last.ckpt
Checkpoint loaded successfully (strict=False)
Task: bass_ft, Max Shift Steps: 206
Training samples per epoch: 90000
Starting training...
Epoch 1/20: 100%|██████████| 3750/3750 [2:15:30<00:00]
Validation: onset_f=0.82, offset_f=0.76
...
```

### Step 6: Monitor Training

```bash
# WandB dashboard (in browser)
# https://wandb.ai/your-username/bass_finetuning

# Watch GPU usage
watch -n 1 nvidia-smi

# Check logs
tail -f amt/logs/bass_finetuning/bass_ft_experiment/train.log
```

**Key metrics to monitor**:
- `validation/onset_f`: Onset F1 score (target: >0.80)
- `validation/offset_f`: Offset F1 score (target: >0.75)
- `validation/macro_note_f`: Note-level F1 (target: >0.75)
- `train/loss`: Should decrease steadily

**When to stop**:
- Validation metrics plateau for 5+ epochs
- Train/validation loss diverge (overfitting)
- Reach target accuracy (e.g., onset_f > 0.85)

### Step 7: Evaluate Fine-Tuned Model

```bash
# Test on validation set
python train.py bass_ft_experiment@epoch=15.ckpt \
    -p bass_finetuning \
    -d slakh_bass_only \
    -tk bass_ft \
    --test

# Output: Detailed metrics per instrument class
```

### Step 8: Repeat for Other Stems

```bash
# Drums fine-tuning (3-4 days)
python train.py drums_ft_experiment -p drums_finetuning -d slakh_drums_only -tk drums_ft ...

# Other fine-tuning (3-4 days)
python train.py other_ft_experiment -p other_finetuning -d slakh_other_only -tk other_ft ...

# Vocals fine-tuning (3-4 days)
python train.py vocals_ft_experiment -p vocals_finetuning -d slakh_vocals_only -tk vocals_ft ...
```

## Expected Results

### Accuracy Improvements (Estimated)

Based on similar stem-separation + fine-tuning approaches in literature:

| Metric | Baseline (Full Mix) | After Fine-Tuning (Stems) | Improvement |
|--------|---------------------|---------------------------|-------------|
| **Bass Onset F1** | 0.72 | 0.85-0.90 | +18-25% |
| **Bass Note F1** | 0.65 | 0.80-0.85 | +23-31% |
| **Drums Onset F1** | 0.78 | 0.88-0.92 | +13-18% |
| **Vocals Onset F1** | 0.70 | 0.82-0.88 | +17-26% |
| **Overall Note F1** | 0.68 | 0.82-0.87 | +21-28% |

**Why improvements are expected**:
1. **Reduced polyphonic interference**: Bass model only sees bass notes, no confusion with guitar/piano
2. **Specialized patterns**: Drum model learns drum-specific rhythms (ghost notes, flams, rolls)
3. **Timbre focus**: Each model learns timbre characteristics of its stem
4. **More training data per instrument**: Full Slakh dataset for each stem vs shared across all instruments

### Inference Time Impact

| Approach | Inference Time (149s audio) | Notes |
|----------|----------------------------|-------|
| **Baseline (single model)** | 17.8s | Current YourMT3 |
| **Stems + 4 models (sequential)** | 71.2s (4× 17.8s) | Demucs: 12s + 4 models |
| **Stems + 4 models (parallel, 4 GPUs)** | 29.8s (17.8s + 12s) | Demucs + parallel inference |

**Optimization options**:
- Use smaller models for less important stems (e.g., "other")
- Quantize models to INT8 (2× faster, <1% accuracy loss)
- Batch process stems together (not fully parallel, but reduces overhead)

---

## Decision Criteria

### ✅ Proceed with Idea 1 if:

- [x] **You have access to A10G GPU or better** (Brev ✅)
- [x] **You can allocate ~1.2TB storage** (external drive or cloud)
- [x] **You have 2-3 weeks for fine-tuning** (12-20 days sequential)
- [x] **Budget allows $350-500 for GPU compute** (Brev cost)
- [x] **You're comfortable with PyTorch Lightning training** (or willing to learn)
- [x] **Demucs integration already working** (you have this ✅)

### ⚠️ Reconsider if:

- [ ] No GPU access (fine-tuning on CPU = weeks → months)
- [ ] Storage limited (<500GB free)
- [ ] Timeline urgent (<1 week)
- [ ] Budget constrained (<$100)
- [ ] Need production-ready immediately

### Alternative: Proof of Concept First

**Before full fine-tuning**, test the hypothesis:

```python
# Test 1: Current model on isolated stems (no fine-tuning yet)
stems = demucs_separate("test_audio.flac")
bass_midi = yourmt3.transcribe(stems['bass'])  # Use current checkpoint
bass_full_midi = yourmt3.transcribe("test_audio.flac")  # Full mix

# Compare accuracy:
# If bass_midi is significantly better than bass notes from bass_full_midi,
# then fine-tuning will likely improve even more.
```

**Expected PoC results**:
- Bass from stem: +10-15% accuracy vs bass from full mix
- Drums from stem: +8-12% accuracy vs drums from full mix

**If PoC succeeds** → Proceed with fine-tuning ✅
**If PoC fails** → Investigate why stems don't help before fine-tuning ⚠️
